rm -> remove (directory or file)
mv -> move a file to another place
cp -> copy another file 
scp -> copy to/from remote server
wget -> download from online

Print commands:
cat -> Display content of a file
head -> Display beginning 
tail -> Display sending of a file
less -> Display file with interactive screen

sort -> sort file ascending/descending order input lines
find -> List all the files that march keywords
grep -> list all the lines of file containing keyword

grep flags:
-w Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.
-i Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so that characters that differ only in case m>
-F Interpret PATTERNS as fixed strings, not regular expressions.
-f FILE Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line
-n Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.
-m NUM Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.
-c Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.
-x Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line.
-v Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.
-H Print the file name for each match. This is the default when there is more than one file to search.
-l Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which output would normally>
-o Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line
-E Interpret PATTERNS as extended regular expressions (EREs, see below).
-P Interpret I<PATTERNS> as Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCREs) (a|b|c|d|e|f|g)


Redirecting streams:
< redirect input for the command
> redirect output for the command
>> redirect output without removing old content of output
| redirect outcomes of command to another command

Regular Expression:
Syntax:      Funcitonality:
.            Any character
^            Start of line
$            End of the line
\<           Start of word
\>           End of word
\            Escape after characters
i            Flag to grep inside
|            Logical or
*            Zero or more
+            One or more
?            Zero or one
()           Group together
[]           Character set 
[^]          Neg character set
[a-z]        All lowercase
[A-Z]        All uppercase
[0-9]        All digits
\|           Back reference -> earlier
{n}          Matches exactly n occurences
{n,}         Matches preceding Element
{n,m}        Matches n to an element


Control Operators:
; -> concatenate commands
&& -> run second if first succeeds
|| -> run second if first error


for loops:
for i in $(seq 1 100) "file${i}.txt; 
for i in $(seq 1 100); do mv "file${i}.txt" "file${i}.dat"
